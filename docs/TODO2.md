- init.d script can/should be added to /etc/sysupgrade.conf
- Create containers from podman compose
- On container delete be sure to remove the init.d service
  - Can a service remove itself if container do not exist anymore?
- Import volume from tar. At the moment it only supports tar.gz. Maybe with a checkbox chooseable for the user.
- Make firewall zone configurable, maybe with a uci config, ideas are welcome
- Form in modal does not clear after submit (secrets, network, ...)
- Port mappings are not shown in container details
  - Show them as link with configured ip maybe
- Restart inside container details do not work
- Container List Link Tooltip with assigned IPs (if running) and mapped ports
